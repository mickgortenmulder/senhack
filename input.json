Most people would have caved and said, \"I guess...\" he stood his ground, even though out of fear, it was still impressive to look a TV audience in the face and say, \"I\u0027m not going to do that!\" that absolutely takes balls. \n\n5/10 would laugh and cringe at his emotional pain again.",

I don\u0027t get it.\n\nIts like every show that these animals get brought to the host is always afraid.\n\nAlso most animals can sense that a person is nervous or afraid which makes them feel uneasy. Literally what you don\u0027t want to do is what Kevin and Jimmy are doing. Freaking out is 100X worse for you and the animal than simply remaining calm",

Video game bad guy Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman) must risk it all by traveling to the world wide web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope?s video game, Sugar Rush. In way over their heads, Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizens of the internet?the netizens?to help navigate their way, including a webite entrepreneur named Yesss (voice of Taraji P. Henson), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making site ?BuzzzTube.?

Second if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking missiles at Gru, he then dodges them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the sixe of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. Plus after this Gru punches a chark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That\u0027s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case",

I think so many DW fans are just so incredibly resistant to change, which is mad when you consider the entire premise of the show *is* change.

Since when is the Doctor passive in this sort of exchange? The methods differ, but the Doctor is known to firmly assert their authority when questioned; this is important so nobody else does anything stupid. Instead, it appears they just stand there and let others talk for them.\n\nWorse, I have a feeling this is going to, in context of the episode, be played as ?man is questioning woman\u0027s authority based on sexism?, which makes it rather glaring that instead of the Doctor defending herself? two male companions (and I guess a female who\u0027s oddly offscreen?) do it for her.

This is further evident in his decision not to include any characters or adversaries from previous series.\n\nBut I do not believe this is what fans want?it is certainly not what I want. Few people have seen every single episode of Doctor Who, which has proven to be of little issue to casual and hardcore fans alike. Chibnall is potentially destroying the little continuity the show has left.\n\nWhile his intentions of shaking up the program?creating novelty?are noble, he is doing it in what will likely prove to be the least sensitive manner to the fidelity of the show.",

Easy since he?s looking at the faces.\n2:05 he has them all deal their top card, which are the Jacks, THEN has them randomly deal the rest. This prevents the Jacks from being mixed up.\n2:58 The Jacks are now at the bottom since he had them deal those first.

When he flips the deck around in his palm  before handing it back to the guy, it momentarily splits at the break and he peeks the selected card. When he gets the cards back, he splits them into four piles with the jacks at the bottom. He does a single card pass when flipping each pile over to keep the jacks on the bottoms. The rest is just psychology.  He has them deal one card (the jack), putting it at the bottom of their piles. They only \"mix\" the top portions from now on. Now, since the jacks are at the bottoms, he needs them at the top. So, he asks them to \"count\" their remaining cards.  Counting into a pile reverses the order, so they all end up with their bottom card on top... which is the jack.",

                            "Alkisah, di sebuah kampung di daerah Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, ada sepasang suami-istri yang mempunyai tujuh orang anak laki-laki yang masih kecil. Anakyang paling tua berumur sepuluh tahun, sedangkan yang paling bungsu berumur dua tahun. Untuk memenuhi kebutuhan hidup mereka, sepasang suami-istri itu menanam sayur-sayuran untuk dimakan sehari-hari dan sisanya dijual ke pasar. Meskipun serba pas-pasan, kehidupan mereka senantiasa rukun, damai, dan tenteram.\n\nPada suatu waktu, kampung mereka dilanda musim kemarau yang berkepanjangan. Semua tumbuhan mati karena kekeringan. Penduduk kampung pun mulai kekurangan makanan. Persediaan makanan mereka semakin hari semakin menipis, sementara musim kemarau tak kunjung usai. Akhirnya, seluruh penduduk kampung menderita kelaparan, termasuk keluarga sepasang suami-istri bersama tujuh orang anaknya itu.\n\nMelihat keadaan tersebut, sepasang suami-istri tersebut menjadi panik. Tanaman sayuran yangselama ini menjadi sumber penghidupan mereka tidak lagi tumbuh. Sementara mereka tidak mempunyai pekerjaan lain kecuali menanam sayur-sayuran di kebun. Mereka sudah berpikir keras mencarijalan keluar dari kesulitan tersebut, namun tidak menemukan jawabannya. Akhirnya,mereka bersepakat hendak membuang ketujuh anak mereka ke sebuah hutan yang letaknya jauh dari perkampungan.\n\nPada suatu malam, saat ketujuh anaknya sedang tertidur pulas, keduanya bermusyawarah untuk mencari cara membuang ketujuh anak mereka. ?Bang! Bagaimana caranya agar tidak ketahuan anak-anak??tanya sang Istri bingung.\n\n?Besok pagi anak-anak kita ajak pergi mencari kayu bakar ke sebuah hutanyang letaknya cukup jauh. Pada saat mereka beristirahat makan siang, kita berpura-pura mencari air minum di sungai,? jelas sang Suami.\n\n?Baik, Bang!? sahut sang Istri sepakat.\n\nTanpa mereka sadari, rupanya anak ketiga mereka yang pada waktu itu belum tidur mendengar semua pembicaraan mereka. Keesokan harinya, sepasang suami-istri itu mengajak ketujuh putranya ke hutan untuk mencari kayu bakar. Sesampainya di hutan yang terdekat, sang Ayah berkata kepada mereka:\n\n?Anak-anakku semua! Sebaiknya kita cari hutan yang luas dan banyak pohonnya, supaya kita bisa mendapatkan kayu bakar yang lebih banyak lagi,? ujar sang Ayah.\n\n?Baik, Ayah!? jawab ketujuh anak lelaki itu serentak.\n\nSetelah berjalan jauh, sampailah mereka di sebuah hutan yang amat luas. Alangkah gembiranya mereka, karena di hutan itu terdapat banyak kayu bakar. Mereka pun segera mengumpulkan kayu bakar yang banyak berserakan. Ketika hari menjelang siang, sang Ibu pun mengajak ketujuh anaknya untuk beristirahat melepas lelah setelah hampir setengah hari bekerja.\n\nPada saat itulah, sepasang suami istri itu hendak mulai menjalankan recananya ingin meninggalkan ketujuh anak mereka di tengahhutan itu. ?Wahai anak-anakku! Kalian semua beristirahatlah di sini dulu. Aku dan ibu kalian ingin mencari sungai di sekitar hutanini, karena persediaan air minum kita sudah habis,? ujar sang Ayah.\n\n?Baik, Ayah!? jawab ketujuh anak itu serentak.\n\n?Jangan lama-lama ya,Ayah... Ibu...!?? sahut siBungsu.\n\n?Iya, Anakku!? jawab sang Ibu lalu pergi mengikuti suaminya.\n\nSementara itu, setelahmenunggu beberapa lama dan kedua orangtua mereka belum juga kembali, ketujuh anak itu mulai gelisah. Mereka cemas kalau-kalau kedua orangtua mereka mendapat musibah. Akhirnya, si sulung pun mengajak keenam adiknya untuk pergi menyusul kedua orangtua mereka. Namun, sebelum meninggalkan tempat itu, anak ketiga tiba-tiba angkat bicara.\n\n?Abang! Tidak ada gunanya kita menyusulayah dan ibu. Mereka sudah pergi meninggalkan kita semua,? kata anak ketiga. ?Apa maksudmu, Dik?? tanya si Sulung.\n\n?Tadi malam, saat kalian sudah tertidur nyenyak, aku mendengar pembicaraan ayah danibu. Mereka sengaja meninggalkan kita di tengah hutan ini, karena mereka sudah tidak sanggup lagi menghidupi kita semuaakibat kemarau panjang,? jelas anak ketiga.\n\n?Kenapa hal ini baru kamu ceritakan kepada kami?? tanya anak kedua.\n\n?Aku takut ayah dan ibu murka kepadaku, Bang,? jawab anak ketiga.\n\nAkhirnya ketujuh anakitu tidak jadi pergi menyusul kedua orangtuanya, apalagi hari sudah mulai gelap.Mereka pun segera mencari tempat perlindungan dari udara malam. Untungnya, tidak jauh dari tempat mereka berada, ada sebuah pohon besar yang batangnya berlubang seperti gua. Mereka pun beristirahat dan tidur di dalam lubang kayu itu hingga pagi hari.\n\n?Bang! Apa yang haruskita lakukan sekarang? Ke mana kita harus pergi?? tanya si anak kedua.\n\n?Kalian tunggu di sini! Aku akan memanjat sebuah pohon yang tinggi. Barangkali dari atas pohon itu aku dapat melihat kepulan asap. Jika ada, itu pertanda bahwa di sana ada perkampungan,? kata si Sulung.\n\nTernyata benar, ketikaberada di atas pohon, si Sulung melihat ada kepulan asap dari kejauhan. Ia pun segera turun dari pohon dan mengajak keenam adiknya menuju ke arah kepulan asap tersebut.Setelah berjalan jauh, akhirnya sampailah mereka di sebuah perkampungan. Alangkah terkejutnya mereka ketika melihat sebuah rumah yang sangat besar berdiri tegak di pinggir kampung.\n\n?Hei lihatlah! Besar sekali rumah itu,? seruanak keempat.\n\n?Waaahhh... jangan-jangan itu rumah raksasa,? sahut anak keenam.\n\nBaru saja kata-kata itu terlepas dari mulutnya, tiba-tiba terdengar suara kerasdari dalam rumah itu meminta mereka masuk ke dalam rumah. Beberapa saat kemudian, penghuni rumah itu pun keluar. Rupanya, dia adalah raksasa betina.\n\n?Hei, anak manusia! Kalian siapa?? tanya Raksasa Betina itu.\n\n?Kami tersesat, Tuan Raksasa! Orang tua kami meninggalkan kami di tengah hutan,?jawab si Sulung.\n\nMendengar keteranganitu, tiba-tiba si Raksasa Betina merasaiba kepada mereka. Ia pun segera mengajak mereka masuk ke dalam rumahnya, lalu menghidangkan makanan dan minumankepada mereka. Oleh karena sudah kelaparan, ketujuh anak itu menyantap makanan tersebut dengan lahapnya.\n\n?Habiskan cepat makanan itu, lalu naik ke atas loteng! Kalau tidak, kalian akan dimakan oleh suamiku. Tidak lama lagi ia datang dari berburu,? ujar Raksasa Betina.\n\nOleh karena takut dimakan oleh Raksasa Jantan, mereka pun segera menghabiskan makanannya lalu bergegas naik ke atas loteng untuk bersembunyi. Tidak lama kemudian, Raksasa Jantan pun pulang dari berburu. Ketika membuka pintu rumahnya, tiba-tiba ia mencium bau makanan enak.\n\n?Waaahhh... sedapnya!? ucap raksasa jantan sambil menghirup bau sedap itu.\n\n?Bu! Sepertinya ada makanan enak di rumah ini. Aku mencium bau manusia. Di mana kamu simpan mereka?? tanya Raksasa Jantan kepada istrinya.\n\n?Aku menyimpan mereka di atas loteng. Tapi mereka masih kecil-kecil. Biarlah kitatunggu mereka sampaiagak besar supaya enak dimakan,? jawab Raksasa Betina.\n\nSi Raksasa Jantan pun menuruti perkataan istrinya. Selamatlah ketujuh anak itu dari ancaman Raksasa Jantan. Keesokan harinya, ketika si Raksasa Jantan kembali berburu binatang ke hutan, si Raksasa Betina pun segera menyuruh ketujuh anak lelaki itu pergi. Namun, sebelum mereka pergi, ia membekali mereka makanan seperlunya selama dalam perjalanan. Bahkan, si Raksasa Betina yang baik itu membekali mereka dengan emas dan intan.\n\n?Bawalah emas dan intan ini, semoga bermanfaat untuk masa depan kalian,? kata Raksasa Betina.\n\n?Terima kasih, Raksasa Jantan! Tuan memang raksasa yang baik hati,? ucap si Sulung seraya berpamitan.\n\nSetelah berjalan jauh menyusuri hutan lebat,menaiki dan menuruni gunung, akhirnya tibalah mereka di tepi pantai. Mereka pun segera membuat perahu kecil lalu berlayar mengarungi lautan luas. Setelah beberapa lama berlayar, tibalah mereka di sebuah negeri yang diperintaholeh seorang raja yang adil dan bijaksana. Di negeri itumereka menjual semuaemas dan intan pemberian raksasa kepada seorang saudagar kaya. Hasil penjualan tersebut, mereka gunakan untukmembeli tanah perkebunan. Masing-masing mendapat tanah perkebunan yang cukup luas. Ketujuh bersaudara itusangat rajin bekerja dan senantiasa saling membantu.\n\nBeberapa tahun kemudian, mereka puntelah dewasa. Berkat kerja keras selama bertahun-tahun, akhirnya mereka memiliki harta kekayaan yang banyak. Kemudian masing-masing dari mereka membuat rumah yang cukup bagus. Ketujuh lelaki itu pun hidup damai, tenteram dan sejahtera. Pada suatu hari, si Bungsu tiba-tiba teringat dan merindukan kedua orangtuanya. Ia pun segera mengundang keenam kakaknya datang ke rumahnya untuk bersama-sama pergi mencari kedua orangtua mereka.\n\n?Maafkan aku, Kakakku semua! Aku mengundang kalian ke sini, karena ingin mengajak kalian untukpergi mencari ayah dan ibu. Aku sangat merindukan mereka, dan aku yakin, merekapasti masih hidup,? ungkap si Bungsu kepada saudara-saudaranya.\n\n?Iya, Adikku! Kami jugamerasakannya seperti itu. Kami sangat rindu kepada ayah dan ibu yang telah melahirkan kita semua,? tambah anak keenam. ?Baiklah kalau begitu! Besok pagi kita bersama-sama pergi mencari mereka. Apakah kalian setuju?? tanya si Sulung. ?Setuju!? jawab keenam adiknya serentak.\n\nKeesokan harinya, berangkatlah ketujuh orang bersaudara itu mencari kedua orangtua mereka. Setelah berlayar mengarungi lautan luas, tibalah mereka disebuah pulau. Di pulau itu, mereka berjalan dari satu kampung ke kampung lain. Sudah puluhan kampung mereka datangi, namun belum juga menemukannya. Hingga pada suatu hari, mereka pun menemukan kedua orangtua mereka di sebuah kampung dalam keadaan menderita. Ketujuh orang bersaudara itu sangat sedih melihat kondisi kedua orangtua mereka. Akhirnya, mereka membawa orangtua mereka ke tempat tinggal mereka untuk hidup dan tinggal bersama di rumah yang bagus.\n\nSejak itu, kedua orangtua itu berkumpul kembali danhidup bersama denganketujuh orang anaknya. Mereka senantiasa menyibukkan diri beribadah kepada Tuhan Yang Mahakuasa. Segala keperluannya sudah dipenuhi oleh ketujuh orang anaknya yang sudah cukup kaya.",

This is all about money. This is about Jimmy being jealous of his teammate\u0027s paycheck; so he wants to go to a team where he will get  more than what he would get in MN. He is one of the big 3 on the team but he is not the one that with the most room for improvement. So why pay him like LeBron when he is actually in the Wade, Bosh type role. Plus I really question the odds that he will get more in free agency considering the way he is exiting teams in such a disrespectful manner. Now if he signs with a team like Brooklyn who will have the cap space to extend him as the primary guy, maybe then he will get more than 110 cause I doubt he gets the 150 or more otherwise.",

It\u0027s not a coincidence that every team that Jimmy is on that he is the better player statistically and the team is NO GOOD. The Twolves should be easily a top 3-5 team in the entire league. You aint gonna wanna send him to the Clippers... There\u0027s nothing of value to get for him there. Unless he has some miracle convo with Kawahi n plays there a year before they sign Kawahi next year. If I was Jimmy, Id want to go to the Knicks. Nets as the 2nd option. If you wanna win, like they say about you, then you gotta go to the Eastern Conference... Clippers aint gonna do well even if they sign Kawahi and trade for Butler. They wouldn\u0027t even make the playoffs in the West with those 2. Go to Knicks. Team up with the Unicorn, Porzingis. A young stud in Kevin Knox. And a very capable star in Hardaway Jr, but I feel like they\u0027d deal Hardaway Jr. in the trade for Butler. Id keep Hardaway Jr, myself, tho. If they could keep Kevin Knox, Kristaps Porzingis, and Tim Hardaway Jr, AND sign Jimmy Butler... That\u0027s a very solid team coming outta the Eastern Conference. That\u0027s a top 6 team in the East and a playoff team in the East. Nets would still suck with Russell and Butler. Clippers wouldn\u0027t even make the playoffs in the West even with Kawahi and Butler, and Butler would have to play at least 1 year there by himself on a very bad team until they potentially signed another Max Contract player in the offseason.",

                            "God doesn?t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We?re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we?re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We?ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said ?It is finished? (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren?t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you?ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince?s sermon ?Change what you believe?!",

Also- I\u0027m sure time and planning goes into making a video for (or that includes) a certain product isn\u0027t just as simple as these 25 minute videos make it seem and nobody likes to work for free. So....if you\u0027re going to capitalize on the beauty community buzz and throw something together for shock value \u0026 to gain sympathy for your company in hopes of boosting sales.....girl DO IT I can\u0027t lie I love some drama.....but if you\u0027re doing it disguised as trying to be transparent and open with consumers.....mmmm no that is not cool \u0026 is just as manipulative as the you tubers you\u0027re talking about",

Paying an influencer is pennies compared to creating a traditional campaign. AND they spend all that money to create it and have to pay for online ads that people close, commercials that people fast forward through and paper ads that people throw away. All marketing is basically just an educated guessing game on target audience. At least with influencers they know that your audience can also be, and most likely is, their target audience and paying you is a lot cheaper than traditional campaigns.",

                            "All of these are answered in the book. The talking animals are their souls. Dust is what happens when matter becomes sentient and wants to know more about itself. It both created and connects all the worlds, which are further explored in the two sequels. In the book though, there were three existing Alethiometers, and Lyra wasn?t the only one who could read them, just the only one who could without many years of studying and a reference book on hand. It?s revealed at the end that it was through Grace that she was able to read it. She grows out of it when her daemon settles, signifying that she is an adult. Touching another person?s daemon yourself is extremely taboo, however daemons can touch one another. And you don?t feel your daemons pain in your physical body, it?s like your soul is being ripped out of you, a scene from this book which was omitted from the movie. If you kill someone?s daemon, yes they too will die. Daemons don?t need to eat, or use the toilet, and yes, they must be with their master at all times, though they can go a distance of about 10 feet, depending on the person. The thing about sex is indirectly depicted, as a couple were passionately kissing, and their daemons were cuddling, playing with each other?s fur, and showing affection in the way which animals do. The broken glass was cleaned up by a servant, though the puddle was left, as it was carpet in the book. The person who poisoned the wine was the master of the College, and Lord Asriel was trying to get money from him, so it wouldn?t do well to insult him among the scholars. Yes animals do exist which are not daemons, and you can have a pet which is not a daemon. A daemon is recognizable as one by some sense which the narrator could not describe, and animals can easily differentiate a daemon, as it would appear as simply human to a regular animal. The Bear King is a big deal. The armored bears rule over Svalbard, the north of this world, and they hold incredible influence. Yes the masters are always at least partially aware of their daemons actions, idk about the footsie thing. The reason daemons talk mostly to only their human and to other daemons is another taboo, it?s considered a great honor if someone else?s daemon speaks to you directly. Typically when daemons speak to their humans it isn?t actually in English, they understand each other, but it the daemons words would sound like whispered gibberish to anyone else. The thing about daemons taking the form of aquatic creatures is addressed, when a sailor?s daemon settled as a dolphin. As a result, he had to live on a boat for the rest of his life. Also, a daemon doesn?t take permanent form until puberty. It?s called settling, when it takes on its final form, and until then, daemons can shift into whatever form they choose. The college was opposed to funding the research into other worlds because the college is run by the Magesterium (the remnants of the Catholic Church) which believes Dust to be the source of Original Sin. By extension, the discovery of another world would be blasphemy, and they would all be persecuted. The form which your daemon takes does hold a stigma as to your future profession. Dogs do typically denote service, due to dogs? subservient and loyal nature. That solid metal vehicle isn?t solid metal, it?s called a zeppelin, and it?s comparable to a blimp. It?s a giant air bag with an engine on the back and a cabin on the bottom. The master couldn?t explain it because he didn?t understand it himself, and he also didn?t have time before she left, as he didn?t want Mrs Coulter to know about the Alethiometer. The thing about the Gobblers is true, though it was explained in a different way. Gobblers was the common people?s way of referring to the kidnappers of children off the streets, and it most likely came from this acronym. The people that threw the net were bounty hunters who would?ve caught any child which case by that way because the GOB offered a cash reward for children. The Gyptians were there because it?s a big seaport and they?re water merchants. They have also been especially targeted by the GOB due to their low/ marginalized social status, and they didn?t figure out who it was until after they saved her. The Alethiometer is a very complicated instrument, and each symbol has thousands of meanings, and it runs on Dust, so yes, you could ask it that, though I don?t personally know which symbols you?d use. Lee Scoresby isn?t a stranger, he?s introduced to her by the Gyptians, and is confirmed trustworthy. Also he literally dies for her later in book two so? your summary is a crass though not incorrect synopsis, though later on in the books, three alternate names are given for dust, each provided by the culture of a different world. They are ?sraf?, ?shadows,? and ?angels.? In the book, she didn?t previously know the boy, but she overcomes her fear of him- a person without a daemon is like a zombie to them- and comforts him anyways. He eventually dies because he doesn?t have his daemon to calm his heart rate and help him settle himself. Yeah they are probably the best two characters in the book too, and they have a background together. Iorek Byrnison defeats Iofur Raknison by faking an injury, then letting Iofur get too cocky. It?s previously established that bears cannot be fooled by tricks, but Iofur was so absorbed by wanting to be human that he didn?t see it, and his desire to be something else is what ultimately led to his demise. It?s also established that the station is extremely poorly organized, and the staff is inattentive, so their sneaking isn?t hard. The adults believed that by separating children and their daemons, that they were eliminating the source of sin. However every time they tried it on an adult, they died, so they simply accepted that it was too late for them. About the beetle- yes, that is exactly what she did. Iorek was able to sneak up because of a snowstorm and Lyra?s plan to free all the kids using a fire alarm and the station?s lack of control/ discipline/ organization. It?s the Catholic Church, what do you expect, logic? Also they didn?t even finish all the stuff that happened in this single book. They cut it off before asriel blew a hole in the sky, killed roger, Lyra finding out that Asriel is actually her dad and that Mrs Coulter is her mom, and so freaking much in the middle.",

The FDA allows 750,000 particles of INFECTIOUS PUSS per ONE CC of MILK!! INFECTIONS PUSS is in every single drop of milk and cheese and any dairy product. Plus those poor cows are CONSTANTLY RAPED in order to stay pregnant and produce PUSS MILK. Then their babies are ripped out of them and killed within 72 hours if he is a male baby calf. Cows are mammals. We are mammals. A cow\u0027s gestation period is 9 months. A human\u0027s gestation period is 9 months. A cow calls for her dead killed baby calf for weeks and weeks and weeks NONSTOP. And this happens to ALL FEMALE COWS YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR until they drop from exhaustion from being OVER-MILKED AND OVER-IMPREGNANTED AND THEN they are dragged to the slaughterhouse to have a bolt gun shoot a bolt between their trembling, scared, tear-filled eyes, then hung upside down, still alive while having their limbs sawed off while still alive and feeling every single bit of that pain then having their throats sliced open while being upside down and alive and then turned into MCDONALDS HAMBURGERS. HUMAN BEINGS ARE MONSTERS for doing this to other species! We have GOT TO STOP THIS vicious cycle of cruelty, violence and inhumane treatment of sentient animals!! The egg industry is just as tortuous and disgusting. Baby male chicks go down a conveyor belt and are ground up alive while chickens live 2 years in a small crowded cage never being released, standing on painful metal cages until they die of infections or being eaten alive by maggots and other chickens in the same cage. Nursing pigs are confined to metal indoor crates their whole lives too, never able to move or protect their precious little babies who die helplessly.

Or they have power poles made of concrete or steel that are stronger than the cheaper timber. The reason they are upgraded more is because those communities have overall higher taxes which in many cases gets invested into a more costly electrical grid. Sometimes it\u0027s just a political matter where politicians fight for those communities to get upgraded power grids to garner political donations. Sometimes it\u0027s just a money issue where there isn\u0027t enough money coming out in taxes from a poor community to upgrade an old power grid. It is also possible that just one side of this community, the poorer side, received more damage due to the storm and it has nothing to do with the power grid at all. Its hard to tell what the case is in this situation. The power company tends to try to restore the power of communities that receive the least damage first because it gets more people power alot quicker than dedicating huge resources to the most heavily damaged areas which will take longer anyway. I hope all these ppl get help, and understand the woman\u0027s frustration but I think ppl need to be careful with making this into a rich versus poor issue. Some may argue well why don\u0027t we all have upgraded power, and the answer will be are you willing to pay more taxes to do it? Which most ppl would say no because it\u0027s only once in every 30years ppl in these states get these kind of hurricanes. I\u0027m just saying let\u0027s try our best to help each other instead of blaming others or the system so quickly. Sometimes the system is wrong, and sometimes these things are not intentional. They are just a result of multiple factors that are not easy to control.",

Last time we went weeks without power and every tree was sideways from the winds. I can go on but just saying this happens all the time down here and because no one else is effected not many care. I feel terriable for all the victims here effected. Durning Irma our huge Oak tree fell and knocked down a live powerline that went down in our back yard. of course in standing water cause we were all flooded out. I also have a one and a two year old that loves to run off in the yard. Anyways it took almost 2 months for someone to attend to it because commercial will always come before residential. Everyone is too busy with thier own lives until they are directly affected.. how many of these victims cared and helped Irma, Harvey, or Katrina victims cause these storms were far worse though this is still devastating. And I have never heard of cops checking on people or patrolling.. theres too many people for that. They go where needed and when.. you get a curfew and some locations where you can pick up a few goods if any is left.. its sad but its a storm.. there are plenty of warnings to get out..",

I knew it was fake and just cant stand bad acting when I see it.. but now I see it years later and I wwe changed everything, every fighter is brand new never heard or seen them in my life, Id expect to see atleast one og or two but they were all LAME new wrestlers only one that was familiar was Miz or whatever that guys name is and I remember how trash he was when he first started ?? and look at him now hahaaha I was watching wresting when it was good HHH,  Bautista rey misterio ric flair, randy orton shawn micheals those were good wrestlests worth watching now I tried to watch this and jesus its horrible.. so my question is why do you grown men still watch this?

I am constantly arguing with people that you can be a \"photographer\" with just a phone, which, yes they take good photos, but you did good to point out the differences between professional equipment and mobile devices. I really appreciate that because I still don\u0027t agree that you can be a photographer without understanding the way that professional equipment works. Also, I am coming from an iPhone 8 and I am very glad that you covered the focusing process of the new camera, as I have ALWAYS complained and had issues with it before with previous models. I have issues reaching the top of the screen already, with just the 8, so I definitely think the Max is out of question for me, if you had trouble with it as well. Great review.",

He hoped that the European project would go on to become the blueprint for a society run entirely by the global elite over a completely powerless population. He wrote that he wished to see the end of national sovereignty and self-determination and he believed that nationalism, and indeed the very concept of nations, could be demolished through multi-culturalism. He wrote that a society that was racially and ethnically diverse was one which was easily controllable by the political elite.\n\nAccording to Kalegri, a diverse and multi-cultural people were easy to control as they had no common identity to rally behind in the event of a political crisis. In addition to that, a diverse population would be easy to conquer by the means of divide and rule. The newly arrived immigrants would be pitted against the native people with both sides believing that they were a persecuted minority languishing under a system of law that was rigged against their favour",

It?s important that the recipe is the same for your chocolate chip cookies! Look for precision and variations in humidity/climate. Sugars have properties that are called hygroscopic properties, they soak up moisture from the air; starches can do it as well. Whether you have a real moist/ humid environment, or it\u0027s even just a rainy day, where you\u0027re making your cookies is gonna make a difference.\n\nButter:\nPutting the butter in the microwave to melt butter is okay, but in doing so, you get some liquid and solid portions - so it\u0027s not gonna be a great way to mix your sugar. Using room-temperature butter is a really good idea, that\u0027s useful for the creaming method. When you use room-temperature butter you can incorporate lots of air. When you add crystal and sugar to the mix, that makes for a nice porous, light kind of cookie. Using melted butter not only gives that butter flavor, but it?s going to be more-so evenly distributed throughout the entire batter; you?re gonna get a more dense chewy cookie. \n\nChocolate Chips\nSome of the chocolates that you get may be in a chocolate chip bag might not be the highest quality. Do they taste good? Yes, but they?re not gonna be tempered, they may have emulsifiers added to them. They may also have other ingredients that won\u0027t cause them to melt as easily as some of your coverture chocolate does. When they have been tempered, they go through a conching process, which will result in more of a layering effect.\n\nSalt:\nWhen you think of a chocolate chip cookie, you\u0027re probably thinking first and foremost about the sweetness of the cookie. But ironically, if you add a little bit of sea salt, or any kind of salt, to the top of your cookie it\u0027s going to really enhance the flavor. Studies have shown that some of the sweetness associated sensory cells, that used to be found just in the gut in mice, now are enhanced by the presence of sodium. We get sodium from the salts that we eat. Smoking salt is an unique idea. The smoky quality, and the smoky flavors, are going to balance out the bitter quality of the chocolate, saltiness as well as the sweetness from the rest of the cookie.\n\nBaking Soda/Baking Powder:\nMany traditional chocolate chip cookie recipes call for the use of sodium bicarbonate - or baking soda. When you heat sodium bicarbonate, you get something called sodium carbonate; which has a little bit of a soapy bitter taste. To balance that out, you want to add an acidic component. If you\u0027re using the baking soda, you\u0027re going to need an acid. And if you\u0027re using just baking powder, the acid is already in there in a chemical form so you\u0027re good to go.\n\nRest:\nWhen you let your dough rest for 24 hours, there\u0027s a lot going on during that time. When you do that, one of the important things is hydrating some of your flavoring components, when they\u0027re mixed well, your flavor profile becomes far more complex which makes a good cookie.\n\nSugar:\nWhen it comes to sugars, you have options. You can use white sugar, which is crystal and sucrose. Brown sugar has sucrose, but it\u0027s also coated with molasses. Molasses is a byproduct of the sugar\nmaking better processing. You also have things like magnesium, iron, and other types of minerals that add a depth of flavor to the brown sugar that you won\u0027t have with the white sugar. The brown sugar\nalso have a capacity to hold on to water, and so you\u0027re gonna have a moist, chewy, more-dense kind of cookie when you have the brown sugar.\n\nSweet Conclusion:\nSo, there?s a whole lot going on chemically with chocolate chip cookies. It\u0027s all about knowing the ratios and ingredients that you want to use in your recipe. Knowing how they work with the other ingredients that are there, are going to make your cookie have the different types of properties that you are looking for. But regardless of all of that, everybody\u0027s always gonna love chocolate chip cookies. ??",
